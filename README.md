<b>1. Longest Increasing Sub-sequence in an Array</b></br>
    In Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem, find the length of the longest subsequence of a
    given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order
        
        Ex: Input : arr[] = {3, 10, 2, 1, 20,4,56,78,90}
        Output : Length of LIS = 6
        The longest increasing subsequence is 3, 10, 20, 56, 78, 90
    
  
   Usage :Replace Your array with arr array and run it, `static  int [] arr ={3, 10, 2, 1, 20,4,56,78,90};`


<b>Pancake Problem</b>

Suppose you are given a stack of n pancakes of different sizes. You want to sort the
pancakes so that smaller pancakes are on top of larger pancakes. The only operation you
can perform is a flip â€” insert a spatula under the top k pancakes, for some integer k
between 1 and n, and flip them all.
